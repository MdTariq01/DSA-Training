# DSA-Training-Java

This repository is my personal log of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  

---

## 📌 What’s Inside
I’ll be implementing and practicing topics step by step:
- Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists  
- Stacks, Queues, and Hashing  
- Trees and Graphs  
- Searching and Sorting techniques  
- Recursion, Backtracking, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming  

---

## 📝 Practice Problems
Alongside implementations, I’ll also be solving problems from:
- **LeetCode**  
- **Codeforces**  
- **GeeksforGeeks**  
- and other coding platforms  

Each problem solution will come with **clear explanations** and **Java code**.

---

## 🎯 Goal
- Strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts  
- Build problem-solving skills  
- Prepare for coding interviews and contests  

---

## 🚀 Note
This repo will grow weekly as I add new concepts, code snippets, and problem solutions.  
Feel free to explore and learn along with me!  

Happy Learning ✨
